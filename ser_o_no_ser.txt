Shakespeare Soliloquy

To be or not to be, that is the question.
What is more worthy action of the spirit,
suffer the piercing shots of unjust fortune,
or oppose the arms to this torrent of calamities,
and end them with daring resistance?
To die is to sleep. No more?
And for a dream, shall we say, the afflictions are over
and pains without number,
heritage of our weak nature?...
This is a term we should eagerly apply for.
To die is to sleep... and perhaps to dream.
Yes, and see here the great obstacle,
because considering what dreams
may occur in the silence of the grave,
when we have abandoned this mortal remains,
It is a very powerful reason to stop.
This is the consideration that makes our unhappiness so long.
Who, if it were not this, would put up with the slowness of the courts,
the insolence of the employees,
the outrages that pacifico receives
the merit of the most unworthy men,
the anguish of a poorly paid love,
the injuries and injuries of age,
the violence of tyrants,
the contempt of the proud?
When the one who suffers this,
he could procure his quietude with only a dagger.
Who could tolerate so much oppression, sweating,
moaning under the weight of a troublesome life
were it not that the fear that there is something beyond Death
(that unknown country from whose limits no traveler returns)
embarrasses us in doubts
and makes us suffer the evils that surround us;
before going to look for others of which we are not sure?
This foresight makes us all cowards,
thus the natural tincture of courage weakens
with the pale varnishes of prudence,
the most important companies
for this sole consideration they change path,
they are not executed and are reduced to vain designs.
But... the beautiful Ophelia! funny girl,
I hope that my flaws will not be forgotten in your prayers.
